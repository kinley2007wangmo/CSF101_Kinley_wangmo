# Practical 1 – Python Fundamentals

## Overview
This practical introduces the **fundamental concepts of Python programming**, focusing on variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, and logic building.  
The goal was to develop a clear understanding of Python’s core syntax and structure to build a strong foundation for future programming exercises.

---

## Features
- Covered key Python basics:
  - Data types (Booleans, Numbers, Strings)
  - Control structures (`if`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`)
  - Functions and recursion
  - Operators and type conversions
- Included **hands-on practice** with flowcharts and pseudocode.
- Encouraged debugging through **print statements** and logical testing.

## How to Run
1. Open the Python files (e.g., `basics.py`, `operators.py`, `functions.py`) in **VS Code** or any Python IDE.  
2. Ensure **Python 3.x** (e.g., Python 3.13.5) is installed.  
3. Run any program using:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
4. Observe the output in the terminal for each section (Booleans, Loops, Functions, etc.).

## Example Output
```
Boolean Example: True
Arithmetic Example: 10 + 5 = 15
Loop Example: 1 2 3 4 5
Function Example: The sum is 25
```
