# Reflection â€“ Practical 7 (LeetCode Problem Solving)

## Learning Objectives
The main objective of this practical was to apply programming logic and problem-solving techniques to real-world challenges through LeetCode problems.  
It helped reinforce the use of Python in algorithmic thinking and improved my ability to debug, test, and write efficient code.

## What I Learned
- I learned how to analyze problems, design algorithms, and translate logic into Python programs.  
- I gained a deeper understanding of key concepts like arrays, strings, loops, recursion, stacks, and bit operations.  
- Practicing different problems enhanced my logical reasoning and taught me how to approach problems in multiple ways.  

## Challenges Faced
- Some problems required thinking beyond the basic syntax, especially when optimizing solutions for performance.  
- Debugging recursive functions (like Tower of Hanoi) and handling edge cases (in problems such as Two Sum or Valid Parenthesis) were challenging at first.  
- I also faced difficulty choosing the best approach when multiple solutions were possible.

## Learning Outcome
By completing this practical, I became more confident in solving algorithmic problems independently.  
I now understand how to break down a complex problem into smaller steps, write cleaner and more efficient code, and test it properly.

## Conclusion
This LeetCode practical was a valuable learning experience.  
It connected theoretical concepts with real-world applications and improved both my programming and problem-solving skills.  
These exercises also helped me prepare for more advanced topics in algorithms and data structures.
