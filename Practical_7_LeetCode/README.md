# Practical 7 â€“ LeetCode Problem Solving

## Overview
This practical focuses on solving fundamental algorithmic problems from LeetCode using Python.  
Each program demonstrates the use of data structures, loops, conditionals, and problem-solving strategies commonly used in software development and technical interviews.  
The problems help strengthen logical thinking and programming efficiency.

## Features
- Multiple independent Python programs solving real LeetCode problems.
- Clear and simple implementations for each problem.
- Includes commonly tested concepts such as:
  - Arrays and Strings
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Recursion
  - Bit Manipulation
  - Searching and Sorting

## How to Run
1. Open any `.py` file in VS Code or any Python IDE.
2. Make sure Python 3.10 or above is installed on your computer.
3. Run the code using:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   python Two_Sum.py
   ```
4. Follow any input prompts if required, and view the output in the terminal.
