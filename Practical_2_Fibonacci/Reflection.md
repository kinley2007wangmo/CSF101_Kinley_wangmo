# Reflection â€“ Practical 2 (Fibonacci Series)

This file contains my reflections on the topics covered in the Practical 2 folder.  
For each topic, I described what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them.

*Note:*  
I sincerely apologize for not including screenshots of the problems I faced during this practical.  
At the time, I was focused on solving the issues and did not think to capture them.  
I understand that screenshots can greatly help in illustrating challenges and solutions, and I truly appreciate your understanding.  
I will make it a priority to include relevant screenshots in all future submissions to enhance clarity and learning.

## 1. Fibonacci

### 1.1 Iterative Approach
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement the Fibonacci sequence using loops.  
- Understood how to update variables in sequence to generate the next term.

#### Challenges Faced
- Occasionally made mistakes while updating variables, which produced incorrect results.  
- Found it difficult at first to decide how many terms to display.

#### How I Overcame Them
- Used print statements to check values at each iteration and confirm the logic.  
- Practiced with multiple examples until I could confidently generate accurate outputs.

### 1.2 Recursive Approach
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement the Fibonacci sequence using recursion and understood the importance of base cases.  
- Observed how recursion repeatedly calls the same function to build results.

#### Challenges Faced
- Found it confusing to trace recursive calls and sometimes forgot to include proper base cases, leading to errors.  
- Noticed that recursion can be slower for large numbers due to repeated calculations.

#### How I Overcame Them
- Drew recursion tree diagrams to visualize function calls and the flow of execution.  
- Added print statements to observe the order of execution and identify where errors occurred.

## Overall Reflection
Practical 2 helped me understand both iterative and recursive approaches to solving problems.  
By practicing both methods, I improved my logical thinking, problem decomposition, and coding skills.

### Future Improvements
- I plan to practice more problems using both iterative and recursive methods.  
- I want to compare the efficiency and time complexity of different approaches in future exercises.
