# Practical 2 – Fibonacci Sequence (Iterative and Recursive Approaches)

## Overview
This practical focuses on generating the Fibonacci sequence using two different methods — iterative and recursive.  
The goal is to understand how loops and recursion can be used to solve the same problem in different ways.  
Through this exercise, I learned to analyze, implement, and test both approaches efficiently.

## Features
- Implementation of the Fibonacci sequence using:
  - Iterative method with loops.  
  - Recursive method with function calls and base cases.  
- Demonstrates differences in execution flow and performance.  
- Clear and simple code for easy understanding.

## How to Run
1. Open the Python file (e.g., `fibonacci.py`) in VS Code or any Python IDE.  
2. Ensure Python 3.x (e.g., Python 3.13.5) is installed.  
3. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   python fibonacci.py
   ```
4. Observe the printed Fibonacci sequence in the terminal.
