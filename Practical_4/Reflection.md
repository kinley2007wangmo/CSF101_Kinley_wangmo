# Reflection – Practical 4 (Linked Lists)

This file contains my reflections on the topics covered in the Practical 4 folder.  
For each topic, I described what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them.

*Note:*  
I sincerely apologize for not including screenshots of the problems I faced during this practical. At the time, I was focused on solving the issues and did not think to capture them.  
I understand that screenshots can help illustrate challenges and solutions clearly, and I truly appreciate your understanding.  
I will make it a priority to include relevant screenshots in all future submissions to enhance clarity and learning.

## 1. Linked Lists

### 1.1 Singly Linked List
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement a singly linked list in Python using classes.  
- Understood how nodes are connected through the `next` pointer to form a chain-like structure.

#### Challenges Faced
- Made mistakes while updating the next pointers, which caused broken links between nodes.  
- Initially found it difficult to visualize the connections between nodes while inserting or deleting.

#### How I Overcame Them
- Created helper functions to print the linked list after each operation to check if it worked correctly.  
- Drew diagrams to visualize the linking of nodes and better understand how data moves through the structure.

### 1.2 Reverse Linked List
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to reverse a singly linked list by updating the direction of pointers.  
- Understood that reversing involves maintaining three pointers — previous, current, and next.

#### Challenges Faced
- Found it confusing to update pointers correctly without losing track of nodes.  
- Accidentally overwrote node references during reversal, which caused runtime errors.

#### How I Overcame Them
- Practiced step-by-step pointer movement on paper to ensure the logic was clear.  
- Used temporary variables and print statements to verify that no node was lost during reversal.

## Overall Reflection
This practical helped me clearly understand how linked lists work and how to manipulate them using pointer logic.  
Implementing and reversing lists improved my knowledge of data structures and the importance of memory references in programming.

### Future Improvements
- I plan to practice more problems involving linked lists and their variations such as doubly and circular linked lists.  
- I will explore more complex linked list operations like insertion at specific positions, deletion by value, and detecting loops.
