# Practical 4 â€“ Linked Lists Implementation

## Overview
This practical focuses on understanding and implementing Linked Lists, one of the most fundamental data structures in programming.  
The exercises involve building a Singly Linked List, performing insertion and reversal operations, and analyzing how data is connected using pointers.

This practical also emphasizes how linked lists differ from arrays and how they allow dynamic memory allocation without predefined size.

---

## Features
- Implementation of a Singly Linked List using Python classes.  
- Functionality to insert, traverse, and reverse the linked list.  
- Hands-on practice with pointer manipulation and node connections.  
- Clear code structure for better understanding and debugging.

## How to Run
1. Open the Python file (e.g., `linked_list.py`) in VS Code or any Python IDE.  
2. Make sure Python 3.10 and above (e.g., Python 3.13.5) is installed.  
3. Run the program using the command:
   ```bash
   python linked_list.py
   ```
4. Observe the printed output showing the linked list before and after reversal.

## Example Output
```
Original Linked List: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40  
Reversed Linked List: 40 -> 30 -> 20 -> 10
```
