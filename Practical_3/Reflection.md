# Reflection â€“ Practical 3 (Stacks and Queues)

This file contains my reflections on the topics covered in the Practical 3 folder.  
For each topic, I described what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them.

*Note:*  
I sincerely apologize for not including screenshots of the problems I faced during this practical.  
At the time, I was focused on solving the issues and did not think to capture them.  
I understand that screenshots can greatly help in illustrating challenges and solutions, and I truly appreciate your understanding.  
I will make it a priority to include relevant screenshots in all future submissions to enhance clarity and learning.

## 1. Queue

### 1.1 Queue Implementation
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement a queue using a class in Python.  
- Understood the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle and how it differs from stacks.  
- Practiced writing functions for `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `display`.

#### Challenges Faced
- Sometimes forgot to handle the case when the queue was empty, which caused runtime errors.  
- Had trouble keeping track of the front and rear positions correctly in the list.

#### How I Overcame Them
- Wrote test cases to check different queue scenarios, including when the queue was empty or full.  
- Used print statements to debug and verify the behavior of the queue step-by-step.

## 2. Stack

### 2.1 Stack Implementation
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement a stack using a class in Python.  
- Understood the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.  
- Implemented operations such as `push`, `pop`, and `peek`.

#### Challenges Faced
- Occasionally forgot to check whether the stack was empty before popping or peeking.  
- Confused the order of operations when removing elements.

#### How I Overcame Them
- Added error handling and condition checks for empty stacks.  
- Wrote test cases for edge conditions to ensure the stack behaved correctly.

## Overall Reflection
This practical helped me understand the core working principles of stacks and queues, two of the most fundamental data structures.  
By implementing them using Python classes, I developed a better understanding of how data can be organized and accessed efficiently.  
Testing different cases also improved my problem-solving and debugging skills.

### Future Improvements
- I plan to practice more problems involving stack and queue variations, such as priority queues and deque structures.  
- I aim to explore real-world applications of stacks and queues in algorithms like expression evaluation and task scheduling.
