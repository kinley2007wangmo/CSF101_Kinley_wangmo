# Practical 3 â€“ Implementation of Stacks and Queues

## Overview
This practical focuses on the implementation of Stacks and Queues, which are essential linear data structures in computer science.  
The goal of this exercise was to understand how these structures manage data flow using the principles of FIFO (for Queues) and LIFO (for Stacks).  
By coding both structures from scratch, I learned how to handle data insertion, deletion, and error checking effectively.

## Features
- Implementation of Queue and Stack using Python classes.  
- Functions include:
  - `enqueue()` and `dequeue()` for Queue.  
  - `push()`, `pop()`, and `peek()` for Stack.  
- Includes test cases for handling empty data structure scenarios.  
- Demonstrates FIFO and LIFO operations clearly through printed outputs.

## How to Run
1. Open the Python file(s) in VS Code or any Python IDE.  
2. Ensure Python 3.x (e.g., Python 3.13.5) is installed.  
3. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   python stack_queue.py
   ```
4. Observe the printed outputs in the terminal showing the results of each operation.

## Example Output
```
Initial Queue: [10, 20, 30]  
After Dequeue: [20, 30]  

Initial Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4]  
After Pop: [1, 2, 3]
```
