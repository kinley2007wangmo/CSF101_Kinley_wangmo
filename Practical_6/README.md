# Practical 6 â€“ Searching Algorithms (Linear and Binary Search)

## Overview
This practical demonstrates the implementation of searching algorithms in Python, focusing on both Linear Search and Binary Search (iterative and recursive methods).  
Searching algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to find the position of a specific value within a list or array.

The goal of this practical is to understand how each algorithm works, compare their efficiency, and observe the difference between iterative and recursive approaches.

## Features
- Linear Search: Sequentially scans each element until the target is found.
- Binary Search (Iterative): Efficiently finds the target in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search range in half.
- Binary Search (Recursive): Performs the same process as iterative binary search but uses recursive function calls.
- Clear test examples to demonstrate how each function works.

## How to Run
1. Open the Python file (e.g., `search_algorithms.py`) in VS Code or any Python IDE.
2. Ensure Python 3.10 and above (e.g., Python 3.13.5) is installed.
3. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   python search_algorithms.py
   ```
4. Observe the outputs in the terminal:
   - The index of the searched value for each algorithm will be displayed.

## Example Output
```
Linear Search: Index of 6 is 7  
Binary Search: Index of 6 in sorted list is 7  
Recursive Binary Search: Index of 6 in sorted list is 7
```
