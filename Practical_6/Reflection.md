# Reflection – Practical 7 - Searching Algorithms (Linear and Binary Search)

## Learning Objectives
The purpose of this practical was to learn and compare different searching techniques — Linear Search and Binary Search — and to understand their efficiency and applications.  
This task helped me practice the use of loops, recursion, and function design in Python.

---

## What I Learned
- I learned how to implement Linear Search by iterating through a list to locate a target value.
- I understood how Binary Search reduces time complexity by halving the search range in each step, making it faster for sorted lists.
- I practiced writing both iterative and recursive versions of Binary Search.
- I gained experience in using `if`, `while`, and `return` statements effectively in algorithmic programming.

---

## Challenges Faced
- Initially, I found it difficult to visualize how the middle index (`mid`) changes in Binary Search.
- Debugging recursive functions was slightly challenging because understanding the call stack took practice.
- Ensuring the list was sorted before performing Binary Search was an important step I learned through trial and error.

## Learning Outcome
By completing this practical, I now understand:
- The difference between Linear Search (O(n)) and Binary Search (O(log n)) in terms of time complexity.
- How recursion works and when it is appropriate to use it.
- The importance of algorithm optimization in programming.

## Conclusion
This practical helped strengthen my understanding of searching algorithms and recursion.  
It improved my logical thinking and coding confidence in solving real-world problems efficiently.  
I can now implement both iterative and recursive solutions to search-related problems.
