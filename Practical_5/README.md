# Practical 5 – Binary Search Tree and Graph Traversal

## Overview
This practical focuses on the implementation of two key data structures in computer science — Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and Graphs.  
It covers how data can be efficiently stored, searched, and traversed using various algorithms such as inorder, preorder, postorder, BFS, and DFS.

Through this exercise, I learned how to design and analyze these structures using Python and gained deeper insight into recursion, traversal logic, and data representation.

## Features
- Implementation of Binary Search Tree (BST) with insertion and traversal methods.  
- Implementation of Graph using adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations.  
- Traversal algorithms:
  - Inorder, Preorder, Postorder for BSTs.  
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) for Graphs.  
- Step-by-step code structure and printed traversal results for clear understanding.

## How to Run
1. Open the Python file(s) in VS Code or any Python IDE.  
2. Ensure Python 3.10 and above (e.g., Python 3.13.5) is installed.  
3. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   python bst_and_graph.py
   ```
4. View the traversal results printed in the terminal.
